Steps of the protocol :
  1. connect to the device (telescope) and the indiserver
  2. send a getProperties which sends back a def* per property
  /!\ it is important to keep in mind that not all def* messages are sent at the same time

  3. before changing the value of a property, change its state to Busy
  3(bis). send a new* to set a new value for a property
  note : the property state should be back to OK after the task is done

  example : to change a property named "PROPERTY_EXAMPLE" composed of numbers, one would
  need first to initiate a new array with current values with the following command :
  new_values = device.getNumber("PROPERTY_EXAMPLE")
  then, the values of the new array are changed using indexes, and the array is sent back with :
  indiclient.sendNewNumber(new_values)

  4. the change in property values can be printed is needed
